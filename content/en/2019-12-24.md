Merry Christmas!

Today is the first Christmas in my baby's life. His grandparents (my parents) send him Christmas gifts shown in the following.

{{< iframe width=120 height=240 src="//rcm-fe.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&bc1=000000&IS2=1&bg1=FFFFFF&fc1=000000&lc1=0000FF&t=kaakaahoe1193-22&language=ja_JP&o=9&p=8&l=as4&m=amazon&f=ifr&ref=as_ss_li_til&asins=B00LMRH01C&linkId=ac47e9aefd15101cf2e76ff0c4a60206" >}}

This toy run around him, and often attack him, then he was scared and crying... The first Christmas may have been a terrible day for him.
