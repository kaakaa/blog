I'm writing this entry for practice for English.

In my daily job and private development, I'm often required to communicate with someone in English. I can read English text, but can't write, listen, and speak English... Until now, I was barely able to communicate in English with supports of Gooogle Translation. However, it takes so long time to get good phrases, and I feel a little incorrectness in my sentences that are constructed like a puzzle.

In order to reduce my cost for communicating in English, I've learned English by reading books, and online learnings. But, my efforts were temporary, so I returned to previous levels every time.

Now, I think that increasing cases that I use English is the best for my English. So I start writing this entry. My entries in English would have a many of incorrectness and doesn't have thoughtful things, but I hope that this activity makes my English better.
